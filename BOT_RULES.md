## Bot Guidelines
You have a strategy you like, but you're tired of clicking through 300 claims several times a round
to find opportunities or execute your strategy? Then bots are for you! We're happy to help.

We'd also like to avoid Sorcerer's Apprentice scenarios, so be actively careful.

**Golden Rule**: create bots that you would like to encounter on the markets.

Expanding that to some specifics:
* **Bots identify themselves in comments.** For example, one of RM's bots comments on each trade: "[NoiseBot] I flip a coin to buy/sell shares."¬ù
* **Bots don't hammer the system.** Query and trade at a reasonable rate. Cache unchanging information. Don't crowd out the humans.
* **Bots use their forecaster's points.** No separate accounts except by special arrangement: we can split your points among bot accounts.
* **Bots are tested in Sandbox before deploying to Predict.** Your first bot must get our approval to run on production. We recommend this for later ones too.
* **Bots are courteous.The usual do's and don'ts and a bit more:** help make the system a place people want to be.
* **Bots have a clear purpose.** If you're "just playing", use `sandbox.replicationmarkets.com`.
