# simple_bot for SciCast / ReplicationMarkets

simple_bot is a very simple SciCast bot. It uses the new simplified bot API
developed in January 2020 for Replication Markets. (See for example, 
[the Swagger docs](https://sandbox.replicationmarkets.com/bot/api_docs#!/Get_Round_Info/get_round_info).)

This API is built around the "change the probability" view of the market.
It assumes you have a model of what the probability should be. 

simple_bot has no real model. It simply makes a 1% change in a random claim, 
and then reverses it, every minute.

## Features:
* Demonstrates how to connect to a SciCastBotSession.
* Defaults to using the 'sandbox' site. 
* Shows how to get your available assets.
* Shows how to get recent trades.
* Shows how to get a particular claim's history.
* Shows how to extract the latest probability from that history.
* Shows how to make a trade with comment.
* Pretty-prints the returned data structures.

## Usage
1. Install the SciCastBotSession client: `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`

2. Get a sandbox account.
  * Visit http://sandbox.replicationmarkets.com
  * Create an account.

3. Get an API key
  * Email your market helpdesk to ask them to give you one.
  * View your profile page to see what it is. (Not your public profile!)

4. Make your API key available to the simple_bot.
  * It assumes you've exported an environment variable BOT_API_KEY. 
    * Unix example: `export BOT_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxx`   (Use a real API key!)
    * Or, set this in your IDE under Runtime settings.
  * Alternatively, put this in a file and replace the `os.getenv` call with
  a file read.
  * As a last resort, just hardcode it.  
    * **But not if you share your code or post to git!**

5. Run the script, e.g. `python simple_bot.py`


Of course, the point is for you to _modify_ simple_bot to do useful things.
